Suppose it is now 11 AM on 30th December 2023, a new artwork called Shattered glass
has just been received by the MAG central warehouse from the artist with artist code 1. The
minimum payment this artist is prepared to accept for this artwork is $25000. You may
assume that artist code 1 only has one artwork titled Shattered glass. Take the necessary
steps in the database to record the required entries for this new arrival (for this task you
may make changes to the provided ARTWORK table).
